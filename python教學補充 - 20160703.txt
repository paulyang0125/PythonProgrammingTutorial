1, 
同學不好意思針對Exercise 16 要請同學將原本要將3個顏色標籤所擷取的命令從以下第一行改成第二行
name_list= bsObj.findAll("span", {"class":"green", "class":"red","class":"blue"}) # previous - wrong
name_list = bsObj.findAll("span", {"class":["red", "blue","green"]}) # correct 

至於第一行代表要BS搜尋SPAN但要符合前面的span有green 或 red兩種屬性的內容
原指令會產生內容為
[<span class="blue">They have decided that
 Buonaparte has burnt his boats</span>,
 
對應的html為下:
 
<p>
"<span class="red">What can one say about it?</span>" replied <span class="green">the prince</span> in a cold,
listless tone. "<span class="red">What has been decided? <span class="blue">They have decided that
Buonaparte has burnt his boats</span>, and I believe that we are ready to
burn ours.</span>"
</p>

原指令會產生內容為:
<span class="blue">Our good and wonderful sovereign has to
 perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble
 that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and
 crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than
 ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must
 avenge the blood of the just one....</span>
對應的html為下::
 
 <p>
"<span class="red">Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand
things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.
She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious
sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is
the one thing I have faith in! <span class="blue">Our good and wonderful sovereign has to
perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble
that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and
crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than
ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must
avenge the blood of the just one....</span> Whom, I ask you, can we rely
on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot
understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has
refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some
secret motive in our actions. <span class="green">What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.
The English have not understood and cannot understand the
self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only
desires the good of mankind.</span> And what have they promised? Nothing! And
what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has
always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe
is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg
says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a
trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored
monarch. He will save Europe!</span>"

2. 

有同學問到mosquitto mosquitto-clients連線時會因為網路環境不同造成封包lost的issue 
這邊不好意思 因為我對MQTT並不熟 所以要隔空抓藥有點難 要找出root cause可能需要實際環境debug才比較有機會
但我大概看了一下 我不確定同學當時有沒試試是否跟client/broker本身QoS level 或相關網路設定有關 例如'persistence' 
因為網路效能的debug其實是蠻耗費時間 所以我可能會先試試低成本方法 如調調一些server參數 看能不能改善

例如
a. 
更改'mosquitto.conf'
persistence true
autosave_on_changes false
autosave_interval 1
max_queued_messages 0
max_inflight_messages 0

b.直接試試由QoS=2, 根據以下文件所描述 看起來q=0雙方是不做handshake acknowledge 
"
Higher levels of QoS are more reliable, but involve higher latency and have higher bandwidth requirements.
0: The broker/client will deliver the message once, with no confirmation.
1: The broker/client will deliver the message at least once, with confirmation required.
2: The broker/client will deliver the message exactly once by using a four step handshake.
"

ex.
subscriber:  
    mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t "test/#" -c -q 2 -i "james bond"
publisher:
    mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test/topic" -m "wowie" -q 2

當然同學以上可能都try過 但如果去看一些網路文章 mosquitto-conf有很多參數可能都會有關(特別很多都有相依性關西) 所以如果真的卡太久 可以姑且試試 

http://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html

c. 更改log為debug mode, 

/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
# Added by GVC
log_type all
# End by GVC

可能要看看一下log像mosquitto.log 看看能不能找出甚麼端倪

using the command tail -f /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log

d. 另外如果可以在不花很大成本的情況下 比較一下其他的MQTT的module如Apollo, JoramMQ可能可以找到意外收穫 
特別是由http://www.scalagent.com/IMG/pdf/Benchmark_MQTT_servers-v1-1.pdf 提及
mosquitto在delivered throughput 好像不太優並且只能有單連線(不確定是否跟Mosquitto是single threaded的程式有關)
