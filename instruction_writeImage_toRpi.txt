1. Download Win32 Disk Imager 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ 

2. Insert the SD card (Normally it's 8GB) back into your computer.

3. Head to the start menu or screen and type "disk management." Open the disk management program and find your SD card in the list. Right-click and delete all the partitions on your SD card. When it's empty, right-click on it and format it (it doesn't matter what filesystem you format it to, your computer just needs to recognize it).

4. Open Win32DiskImager again and browse for your image file (myraspbmc_201606_clean). Select your device from the Device dropdown just as you did before. This time, click "Write" to write the image to the SD card.

5. When it finishes, eject the SD card and re-insert it into your Raspberry Pi. When you boot it up, it should be in the exact same state it was in when you first cloned the SD card.
